Create a Node JS Web API that contain the following endpoints:

/nft/:walletAddress - This queries a specific wallet on a given blockchain network and returns all owned NFTs

/balance/:walletAddress - This returns balance of a specific wallet address on a given blockchain network

You can utilize APIs such as Moralis or you can query using Ethers JS or similar packages.
